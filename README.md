## Test

```
$ rake test:models # model driven (Unit tests)
$ rake test:controllers # only api, deferring to integration-style tests
$ rake test:integration # controller/model interaction driven

$ rake test # Cuz I couldn't get MiniTest to rake. But the tests do run. But I don't
# know how to run only them ...
```
